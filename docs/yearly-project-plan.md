## 1. Project Overview  
**Project Lead:**  Julia Nguyen
**Team Members:**  
**Project Start Date:**  
**Target End Date:**  December 2026
**Summary (3–5 sentences):**  Development of chromatin accessibility biomarkers for breast cancer drug response prediction and validation in cfDNA

## 2. 2026 Goals

List 3–6 major goals for the year. These should align with lab objectives, grants, and upcoming conference/manuscript opportunities.

- Goal 1:  Discovery and validation of ARCHE-drug response associations in preclinical models (via ATAC-Seq)
- Goal 2:  Translation of ARCHEs in cfDNA
- Goal 3:  Validation of ARCHE-drug response associations in patient cohorts using cfDNA
